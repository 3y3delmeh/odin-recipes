# odin-recipes
Starting to apply what I learned from the odin project (Foundation Course)

Now I can say that I'm learning from the course, I was able to insert an image from the website and I put unordered list and the ordered list to make a step by step process and directions to make recipes. 

I also able to include inline style for removing the list-style from the lists and also able to put the relative linking process where in the webpages from own website.
